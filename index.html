<center><div class="copy"> <p class="intro">The number of individuals incarcerated in American prisons is on the rise, according to newly released data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.</p>

<p>The data, which was released last month, shows Texas has the largest incarcerated population of any state, with nearly 140,000 individuals currently behind bars. Meanwhile, Mississippi has the largest prison population per 100,000 U.S. residents.</p>

<p>The numbers, which include both state and federal prison populations, show a rise of two per cent in 2022 (1,230,100) compared to 2021 (1,205,100).</p>

<p>In 2022, just under 470,000 individuals were admitted to a state or federal prison. That’s about 21,000 more admissions than in 2021 and 48,200 more than in 2020.</p>

<p>The number of women in prison increased by nearly five per cent, from 83,700 in 2021 to 87,800.</p>

<p>One-third of individuals in state and federal prisons are Black (32 per cent) despite making up less than 15 per cent of the country’s overall population.</p>

<p>When it comes to sentencing, 96 per cent of people in U.S. prisons in 2022 were serving more than one year behind bars.</p>

<p>“This rise erased the 1% decline reported in 2021 and marked the first increase in the combined state and federal prison population in almost a decade (since 2013),” BJS Acting Director Kevin M. Scott said in a Nov. 30 press release.</p>
